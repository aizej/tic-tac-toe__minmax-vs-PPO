# tic-tac-toe__minmax-vs-PPO
I recently learned how to use PPO so why not use it for something it absolutely wasn't designed for, and compare it with industry standard (minmax)





PPO is an "on policy" algorithm so it tends to get stuck on local optima, that's just one reason why its not as good for tic-tac-toe
